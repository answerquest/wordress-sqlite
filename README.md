# wordress-sqlite
Ready-to-deploy fork of wordpress 4.6 with SQLite Integration, just PHP, no SQL database needed


* Run the `php-sqlite-pdo-test.php` script from browser for a quick check on whether your server supports sqlite.
* Unzip `wordpress-sqlite.zip` to your folder/server location. 
* Place the contents of the extracted `wordpress-sqlite` folder to where you want to deploy your site (ex: `/public_html/` in your FTP server account)
* From your browser, navigate to your server / folder location, and follow the installation steps like in any normal wordpress installation. 
* It will start with language selection, and jump straight to setting the site's name and admin credentials, without bothering with any db connection.
